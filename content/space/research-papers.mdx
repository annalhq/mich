## My reading list of research papers

- [Log Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04761)<br/>
  [Author's explanation](https://x.com/HanGuo97/status/1930789829094297859)<br/>
  Log-linear attention introduces a novel mechanism that overcomes quadratic attention bottlenecks and the fixed-size hidden state of linear models by employing a logarithmically growing set of hidden states with a matmul-rich parallel form, yielding log-linear compute and balanced expressiveness.
- [The Surprising Effectiveness of Negative Reinforcement in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01347)<br/>
  [Author's explanation](https://x.com/tianhongzxy/status/1929596099154633036)<br/>
  This paper finds that Negative Sample Reinforcement (NSR), which solely penalizes incorrect LLM responses, surprisingly proves highly effective in mathematical reasoning tasks, consistently improving Pass@k performance over base models and often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO by refining the model's existing knowledge via probability redistribution, with an upweighted NSR objective further enhancing results.
- [Esoteric Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01928)
  introduces Eso-LMs, a novel language model that fuses autoregressive and Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) paradigms to achieve state-of-the-art performance, notably integrating KV caching for MDMs to enable up to 65x faster inference.

### Older ones

- [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- [Masked Siamese networks for label-efficient learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07141)
  > A new state-of-the-art for self-supervised learning on this benchmark while using nearly 10x fewer parameters than previous best performing approaches and 100x fewer labeled images than current mask-based auto-encode [2022]
- [Rationale behind LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13255)
- [GZip-kNN](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/decoding-the-acl-paper-gzip-and-knn)
- Perceptron and Sparse probabilty
  > Training a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer corresponds to the evolution of a sparse probability measure (sum of Dirac masses) over the neuron's parameter domain (here it is 2D for the regression of a 1D function, slope+position of the ridge).
- [MM1 by Apple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611)
- Grok 1 Architecture:

  Uses MoE layer to enhance training efficientcy of LLMs

1. Attention is scaled by 30/tanh(x/30) ?!
2. Approx GELU is used like Gemma
3. 4x Layernoms unlike 2x for Llama
4. RMS Layernorm downcasts at the end unlike Llama - same as Gemma
5. RoPE is fully in float32 I think like Gemma
6. Multipliers are 1
7. QKV has bias, O no bias MLP no bias
8. Vocab size is 131072. Gemma 256000.
