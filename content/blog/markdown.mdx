# Markdown Playground

Testing my blog post. Here's a variety of Markdown syntax.

## Code Examples

Let's test syntax highlighting with different languages:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User) {
  console.log(`Hello ${user.name}!`);
  return {
    message: `Welcome back ${user.name}`,
    timestamp: new Date()
  };
}
```

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib_sequence = [fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)]
print(f"Fibonacci sequence: {fib_sequence}")
```
## Features

This section demonstrates heading navigation. You should be able to:
1. Click on any heading to get its URL
2. Use the URL to directly navigate to this section
3. See the heading highlight when navigated to


### Lists and Text Formatting

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- ***Bold and italic*** for strong emphasis
- `inline code` for technical terms

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
3. Third ordered item

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote example
> It can span multiple lines
> And supports *formatting*
